"The median element must be greater than (n+m)/2 of the elements". However, this is not necessarily true. E.g.:
5 5 5 5 (5) 5 6 7 8
In the above list, 5 is the median element, but it is not greater than 50% of the elements due to repetitions. In fact, it is greater than 0% of the
elements; 5 is the smallest element value and also the median. If you were to do an index search of 5, it would not be able to place 5 as the median
of this list... However, 5 is greater than or equal to 50% of the list while also less than or equal to 50% of the list.
